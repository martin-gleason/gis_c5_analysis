### Notes about this Map:

* The data comes from the c5 Reporting System on September 28, 2020.
* The data does not have the fields necessary to indicate who is, and who is not, enrolled in probation.
  * This is one of the problems with the reporting system.
* Each address was geocoded through Google Maps API
  * A total of just over 11,500 records
  * Each record was of a person 18 or younger
* With the help of CCGIS, would could design our own polygons seperate from CPD and Judicial Districts.
